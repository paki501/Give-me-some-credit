## 📊 Give Me Some Credit - Credit Risk Analysis Project

This project builds a machine learning system to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan. The dataset is based on the **"Give Me Some Credit"** competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit).

---

### 🔧 Dataset Preprocessing Steps

The dataset contains customer financial characteristics and a binary label (`SeriousDlqin2yrs`) indicating if the customer defaulted on a loan within two years.

**Steps Taken:**
- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Used `SimpleImputer(strategy='median')` to fill missing `MonthlyIncome` and `NumberOfDependents`.
- **Feature Scaling**:
  - Standardized all numerical features using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniform model performance.
- **Target Separation**:
  - Split features (`X`) and target (`y`), and used `train_test_split` (80/20).
- **Class Imbalance**:
  - Notably imbalanced (`~6%` defaults). Addressed using SMOTE (optional for advanced tuning).

### 🤖 Model Selection and Rationale

We selected three tree-based models known for handling tabular data effectively:

1. **Random Forest**
   - Ensemble of decision trees, great at reducing overfitting.
2. **Gradient Boosting**
   - Sequential learning, good for high performance with small tweaks.
3. **XGBoost**
   - Scalable and regularized boosting, often top-performer in competitions.

✅ All models support feature importance and probability outputs.

### 🚧 Challenges Faced and Solutions

| Challenge                                  | Solution                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Imbalanced dataset                        | SMOTE and class weighting explored                                 |
| Missing values in `MonthlyIncome`         | Filled with median (robust to outliers)                           |
| Visualizing model performance             | Added ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix, and AUC for comparison         |
| Slow Streamlit model training             | Option to use pretrained `.pkl` model for faster app performance  |

### 📈 Results with Visualizations and Interpretations

#### 🔍 Classification Metrics (Random Forest Example)

| Metric         | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Accuracy       | ~93%  |
| AUC-ROC Score  | ~0.87 |
| Precision (1)  | ~0.26 |
| Recall (1)     | ~0.66 |

✅ Random Forest had balanced general performance  
✅ Gradient Boosting and XGBoost slightly better in AUC, but slower
